# Snap Game GUI
snap game gui for tafe.

**How to play**

As a little treat I have made the deck of cards its own seperate class if you wish to use this in any of your own
projects!

Simply download the snapgamegui.py and deckofcards.py, place them in the same folder and open this folder in VSCODE
run them in VSCode and you are good to go!


**Rambling**

This repository contains all the requirements in order for you to enjoy my wonderful game of SNAP 
This game takes advantage of the Tkinter and is released under an MIT license

**Reason for choosing Tkinter**
Because it was quick and easy and it has a very simplistic feel to it
